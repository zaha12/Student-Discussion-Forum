/*******
 * <p> Title: ControllerMultipleRoleDispatch Class. </p>
 * 
 * <p> Description: The Java/FX-based Multiple Role Dispatch Page.  This class provides the 
 * controller actions to allow the user to select which role to use for this particular user. 
 * If the user has only one authorized role, this page is not used.  Only when a specific user
 * has been authorized to play more than one role, that user must select which role to play
 * after logging in.  The fact that this user has multiple authorized roles is not made visible
 * before the user logs in.  We believe the system should provide no information until that user
 * has logged in.
 * 
 * The class has been written assuming that the View or the Model are the only class methods that
 * can invoke these methods.  This is why each has been declared at "protected".  Do not change any
 * of these methods to public.</p>
