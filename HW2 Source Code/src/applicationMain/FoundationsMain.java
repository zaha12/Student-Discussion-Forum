/*******
 * <p> Title: FoundationsMain Class </p>
 *
 * <p> Description: 
 * • The Singleton Design Pattern - The GUI uses the MVC Design Pattern, and each of the
 *      		three components is instantiated once.
 *
 * <p> On startup, the application tries to connect with the Foundations in-memory database.  If a
 * connection to the database is currently active, an alert is displayed explaining the situation
 * to the users and the application quits when the user acknowledges the alert.</p>
 *
 *  <p>If the connection is successful, a check is made to see if the database is empty. If so, this
 * must be the first execution of the application and the person running the application is assumed
 * to be an administrator.  That user is required to provide an Admin username and password before 
 * anything else can happen.  Doing this eliminates a common weakness of "hard coded credentials".
 * With that done, the admin can provide more details to the system (e.g., name and email address),
 * and then proceed to do other admin activities.</p>
 * 
 *  <p>If the database is not empty, the system brings up the standard login page and requires an 
 * an existing user to log in or a potential user to provide an invitation code to establish a new
 * account.  Once logged or after creating an account, the user can perform what ever role(s) set
 * for that user.  This class's method stops as soon as the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the
 * one of the two options has been set up.  From that point forward, and actions are performed in
 * reaction to the user engaging with widgets on the currently visible page.</p>
 * 
 *  <p>This application uses singletons and Model View Controller (MVC) View pattern to control the 
 * use of memory by avoiding multiple copies of the same page.</p>
 * 
 *  <p>This application does not use the command line arguments *i.e., "String[] args"), but Java and
 * JavaFX in Eclipse requires they be made available in the application's main method, even if they
 * are not needed.</p>
